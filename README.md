<h3>IBM Machine Translation Models</h3>

<p> The objective of this assignment is to make use of the IBM Models so as to tranlate one language to another. This assignment consists of three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create an Implementation of IBM Model 1</li>
  <li> Make use of the NLTK toolkit of python, so as to compare the results of those results from the previous implementation and the imlementation within the libraries</li>
  <li> To make use of phrase queries, with the help of the functions present within the NLTK toolkit</li>
</ul>

<p> Currently, the program has been structured in the following manner- </p>
<ul> 
  <li><strong> main.py </strong> contains the our implementation of IBM Model 1</li>
  <li><strong> part2.py </strong> contains the results from NLTK </li>
  <li><strong> part3.py </strong> contains the results for the phrase queries</li>
</ul>
