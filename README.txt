************************************    Running the Code    *****************************************
1. Install nltk via pip.

2. The file langsettings.json contains the information about which corpus is being used. 
Edit the "train-data" attribute to change it.
data1.json and data2.json are the provided corpuses and eng-it.json is ours (english-italian).

3. The attributes "source" and "target" in langsettings.json dictate the source language 
and the target language. The attribute "iterations" controls the number of iterations the model does.

3. For part 1, change the required attributes in the langsettings.json file to
the required corpus and run the following command
	python3 part1.py

4. For part 2, again change the required attributes in the langsettings.json file to
the required corpus and run the following command
	python3 part2.py

5. For part 3, once again change the required attributes in the langsettings.json file to
the required corpus and run the following command
	python3 part3.py

6. The results will appear in the terminal.
